# Micro Network

An open protocol for Micro services.

## Overview

The Micro network is a protocol for communication between services across Micro deployments. 
It enables distributed and federated clusters to be built across platform boundaries using 
a header based protocol called MUCP. This can be used for cross region and cross org collaboration. 
MUCP is inspired by the SMTP protocol.

## Status

Currently in the early design phase.
