# Micro Network

An open network for Micro services.

## Overview

The Micro network is a global shared services network. Micro will enable users to run their own nodes 
that offer services to anyone else they peer with. Each node will act as a gateway to the entire network, 
allowing the owner to benefit financially from it's use. The network has the potential to unlock collaborative 
development at scale.

## Status

The project is currently in the early design phase.
