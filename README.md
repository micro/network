# Micro Network

An open network for Micro services.

## Overview

The power of collaborative development has been restricted to trusted environments within organisations. 
These platforms unlock incredible productivity and compounding value with every new service added. 
They provide an always-on runtime and known developer workflow for engineers to collaborate on. 
This has been difficult to achieve outside of organisations.

The Micro network solves this problem by creating a global shared services network. Micro will enable 
users to run their own nodes that offer services to anyone else they peer with. Each node will act as 
a gateway to the entire network, allowing the owner to benefit financially from it's use.

## Status

The project is currently in the early design phase.
