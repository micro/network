# Micro Network

An open protocol for Micro services.

## Overview

The Micro network is a protocol for communication between services on Micro servers. 
It enables distributed and federated clusters to be built over platform boundaries using 
a header based transport called MUCP. The protocol behaves much like SMTP, allowing gateways 
to relay messages beyond a single domain to create a network of networks. 

## Status

Currently in the early design phase.
