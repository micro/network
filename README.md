# Micro Network

An open network for Micro services.

## Overview

The Micro network is a shared global network for Micro services. In an attempt to 
aggregate power using a crowdsourced approach, Micro will enable users to run their own nodes that offer services 
to anyone else they peer with. Each node will act as a gateway to the entire network, allowing the owner to benefit 
financially from it's use.

## Status

The project is currently in the early design phase.
