# Trust Service

The trust service is a reputation based scoring system

## Overview

Trust in a system is an inherently difficult thing to predict. Even as something is secure, running and performant 
it's unclear whether a service is actually producing useful data or correct results. Trust is something that's 
earned overtime. What we propose a reputation based scoring system that establishes the trust score of every 
service based on an aggregated number of factors [uptime, performance, response].
